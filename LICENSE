### Step 4: Make the Script Executable Without `./`
To run the script as `Crt.sh` (without `./`), you need to ensure it’s in your system’s `PATH`. Here’s how:

1. **Move the Script to a Directory in Your `PATH`**:
   - For example, move it to `/usr/local/bin`:
     ```bash
     sudo mv Crt.sh /usr/local/bin/
     ```
   - Now you can run it from anywhere:
     ```bash
     Crt.sh input.json output.txt -v
     ```

2. **Alternatively, Add the Repository Directory to Your `PATH`**:
   - Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:
     ```bash
     export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/Crt.sh-Domain-Extractor"
     ```
   - Reload your shell:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

### Step 5: Commit and Push to GitHub
1. **Stage the Files**:
   ```bash
   git add Crt.sh README.md
